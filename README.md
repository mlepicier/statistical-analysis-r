# Statistical Analysis in R

<p align="justify">This project consists in leveraging the R programming language computation and plotting capabilities to illustrate basic inferential statistics concepts. Having achieved the highest overall grades of my engineering cohort in <b>Inferential Statistics</b>, I volunteered the next semester to mentor students in this class by preparing laboratory work in R to illustrate the key concepts from the lecture. This project was conducted from February 2019 to June 2019 as a student at the <b>University of Technology of Troyes</b>. Below are a few paragraphs to give you context about the project.</p>

## Repository Assets:

- [Inferential Statistics](inferential-statistics/) - [Full Code](inferential-statistics/inferential-statistics-r.ipynb)

## Business Context:

<p align="justify">Along with Mathematics, Statistics is one of the building blocks of Machine Learning algorithms. Most key concepts of inferential statistics are part of the underlying principles behind many descriptive and predicitve analytics methods. Programming languages like R and SAS allow for much quicker calculation as well as a graphical representation which enhance the understanding of key principles and behaviors.</p>
